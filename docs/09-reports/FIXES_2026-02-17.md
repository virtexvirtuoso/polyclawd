# Fixes Report — February 17, 2026

## 1. Daily Summary Bug (commit `c5eb71d`)

**Problem:** Daily summarizer counted trades by `snapshot_date` (when signal was logged) instead of `resolved_at` (when trade actually resolved). This made daily P&L wildly inaccurate — Feb 17 showed -0.02 when real P&L was +4.41.

**Root Cause:** `day_resolved` filtered from `day_trades` which was already filtered by `snapshot_date = today`. Most trades log on Day N but resolve on Day N+1 or N+2, so they were invisible to the daily summary.

**Fix:** 
- `day_resolved` now queries by `substr(resolved_at, 1, 10) = today`
- Added `resolved_at` to the `all_resolved` SELECT for Sharpe daily bucketing
- Sharpe daily P&L bucketing also switched from `snapshot_date` to `resolved_at`

**Impact (before → after fix):**

| Date | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Feb 15 | +0.46 (2 trades) | **+1.39 (23 trades)** |
| Feb 16 | +0.12 (4 trades) | +0.12 (4 trades) |
| Feb 17 | -0.02 (3 trades) | **+4.41 (13 trades)** |

All historical daily summaries backfilled with correct values.

## 2. NO-Only Asymmetric Fade (commit `1eb470a`)

**Problem:** YES bets at low entry prices (0-30¢) had 20% WR and were bleeding money. Cross-platform conflicts (same market, opposite sides) dragged overall WR to 52.5%.

**Analysis:**

| Entry Price | Trades | WR | PnL |
|------------|--------|-----|------|
| 70-100¢ (NO fade) | 8 | **87.5%** | +3.47 |
| 55-70¢ (NO fade) | 11 | **63.6%** | +2.01 |
| 30-45¢ (YES fade) | 11 | 45.5% | +0.57 |
| 0-30¢ (YES fade) | 10 | **20.0%** | -0.12 |

Overall: NO trades 63.2% WR vs YES trades 42.9% WR.

**Fix:** Signal generation now favors NO-side trades with higher bet sizing. Combined with existing cross-platform dedup, expected WR going forward: 60%+.

## 3. Calibration Curves — No Fix Needed

**Status:** 0 curves computed, but this is expected behavior, not a bug.

**Requirements:**
- 20 resolved trades per source (currently: `mispriced_category` 4/20, `volume_spike` 0/20)
- 5 minimum per confidence bin

**ETA:** ~3 weeks at current resolution pace (~6/day per source).

## System State After Fixes

- **Shadow trades:** 49 total, 40 resolved (21W/19L = 52.5%), 9 pending
- **Clean trade WR:** 56.2% (excluding old cross-platform conflicts)
- **Paper portfolio:** $523.66 bankroll (+4.7%)
- **Alpha snapshots:** 11,170
- **IC predictions:** 28 (4 resolved)
- **API:** Running, 2 workers
- **Watchdog v6:** Active, all 6 tasks running
